Since JSM is free for three users, i actually thought i could add this to our site and use since, since we only use three actual \"agents\" for it (we are a small company). But when i try to do that, it get the message \" This site has more users than Free allows.\" Can someone explain to me, how licensing in this mixed-site scenario actually works and what the cheapest solution would be, if only three users would need/use JSM as agents? I'm a bit confused that licensing is not seperated since these are seperate products. Thank you for the feedback,  Kind regards, Simon",

However, the dashboard's data is unreliable because it includes tickets assigned outside an individual's working hours or during their Out-Of-Office periods. Is there a method to pause the SLA timer when someone logs out for the day and resume it when they begin work the next day? Additionally, if an employee is marked Out-Of-Office, the ticket counter shouldn't initiate at all. How can we implement these changes? Please look at the screenshot below:   In the above example, Julia Oliveira\u00a0had 5 tickets flagged for breaching the SLA response time.

Lookup Tables will not work due to there being several hundred forms and the lookup tables is limited to 25, plus this would be a nightmare to maintain due to the volume of forms.

I have mobile VIP tech support agents that we're trying to accommodate, and updating three fields is two too many...  I'd like to be able to have them only fill out the \"All Branches\" (customfield_10217) field and to scrape the rest of the required info from that field. I'm running into issues crafting the proper series of {{lookupObjects}} and edit issues to get this accomplished. Asset Schema In Department I have a \"Company Name\" attribute, and in\u00a0Office I have a \"Department name\" attribute. How it currently works is that the\u00a0Department field will change what is populated based on the on the Company field selection, and the Office will depend on the Department field, based on Filter issue scope. My \"All Branches\" field has the same Filter scope, but no Filter issue scope, as the Office asset field.  Custom Fields My Company Field - customfield_10112 Department Field - customfield_10113 Office Field - customfield_10114 Automation rule errors My automation rule can currently update the Office Asset Field with the All branches with no issue since they share a 1:1 link, and I can correctly query the lookup object and add it to the audit log, but when I try to edit the issue I encounter \"An error occurred while requesting remote information Bad Request\"  I've snipped my current automation rule, but I can't get it to populate Department yet, haven't even tried Company. Hoping someone can steer me in the right direction for this. Thank you",

A customer can submit a ticket which we call Technical Assistance Request (issue type already exists) through the Request Type \"I have a problem\". However, this ticket can be either a Technical Assistance Request (Issue Type) OR a Defect (Issue Type). It is impossible to assign 2 issue types (in this case TAR or Defect) to 1 request type (\"I have a problem\"). How can I manage the fact that a Technical Assistance Request can become a Defect ? The Issue Type \"Defect\" exists but is not link to the Request Type \"I have a problem\". I was thinking about creating another Request Type to cover either the Defect or the Technical Assistance Request but our customers are sometimes not able to make the difference until we investigate further. So it may create some confusion on the customer portal and on the agent view. Any leads on how to manage this aspect? I am sure other admins have face a similar situation. Thank you in advance for your feedback, Coline",

From looking at similar queries I've found we might be able to do it by changing the default assignee in the project settings but we're running into another problem. All of the site admins and the org admins are unable to change this setting even when they're set as admins in the service desk as well as on Jira as a whole so we're really not sure who is able to.  I've tried using the automation settings to get around it but it's running into a similar issue. The obvious solution to me is to create another user \"ToBeAssigned\" or something along those lines that we essentially set as the default assignee but that means potentially paying for another license which we'd like to avoid if we can.

If a Jira software user adds a comment to the Abc-1 issue, then the same comment will be added to the JSM-1 issue by using the global automation rule. In my case, a Jira software user added the two comments(First comment- test1, Second Comment- test2) \u00a0to the Abc-1 issue within seconds. Only the second comment( First comment- test2, Second comment-test2) will be added twice to the JSM-1 issue. As per my knowledge, automation rules take some time (5 to 20 seconds) to pass. So it only takes a second comment twice. One way is we will add the second comment after some time (atleast 15 seconds). Is there any way to solve this issue?",

Here is my Problem: Structure: Test User 1 works for Organization 1. Test User 2 works for Organization 1 and 2. Test User 1 creates a Ticket within Organization 1 and shares it with Test User 2. Now the Service Desk Agent\u00a0unintentionally changes the\u00a0 Organization to Organization 2, which Test User 1 is not part of. Test User 2 still sees the ticket as he is also part of Organization 2. But as Creator, Test User 1 also sees the ticket, which he shouldn't theoretically be allowed to do (even though he created it), as he is not part of Organization 2. I know there is the possibility to prohibit changing the Organization with hiding out the organizations field on the edit screen etc. But in my company for special reasons this is not an opportunity, the field needs to stay visible.  So my question basically are 2: 2) Is there a way to prohibit the Creator (Test User 1 in my Scenario) from seeing his own tickets, when he is not part of Organization his ticket got moved into?  As described at the beginning, it may sound like a unlikely scenario, but you never know... Would appreciate all proposals on how to solve this issue.  Thx, Best Regards,  Robert",

(10 at a time).\u00a0 I was thinking of creating a Agents group and a customer group.\u00a0 Then in the product access putting the Agents group in the 'Product access' are for JSM and put the customer group in the 'Customer access' area. I was then going to add both of those groups to the projects that are needed.

Previously, the following fields appeared at the top of the ticket (in Board View): Assignee, Reporter, Category, Customer, Project Priority, Start Date, Ticket Priority, Collaborators, Story Points, Sprint, and Due Date. (See screenshot) Now these fields are located at the bottom of the ticket. During our initial intake, those are the fields we update, and having to \"page down\" several times to access these fields is time consuming (and irritating). This intake is done in the overall Board view, not in Issue View. Pinning the fields did not move them to the top of the ticket. Our scrum master doesn't see a way to move these fields back to the top of the ticket, and other than \"I - Assign To Me,\" there's no issue action keyboard shortcuts for the fields listed above. Is there a way to move the fields shown in the screenshot to the top of the ticket? Or is there a way to create individualized issue actions and keyboard shortcuts? Maybe not for every field I listed, but at the very least to the Category field, which is the first action we take with an incoming ticket?",

If someone without any relation to the ticket sends an e-mail to the ticket, we get a notification that the person sending the e-mail has no access to the ticket. The person is not automatically added tot the ticket. We then are able to chose whether we would like to add that person as a requested participant.\u00a0This is the desired workflow, as we would not like people to be able to add their selves to a ticket they have to relation to, without any permission. However, if the person in the situation described above sends an e-mail to the ticket with someone in CC, that person gets automatically added as a requested participant. That means someone without any relation to a ticket can add other people to that ticket. Even though they don't have any relation to the ticket as well.

In Jira I have modelled these as user groups of which only 1 approver per group is required to approve the issue. I want to be able to report the waiting time on certain approver groups. To time this, I made an SLA which times the status and then I can report this. However, as some cases require multiple approvals, this method is unable to measure two waiting times, one for team A and one for team B. I have tried to automate the workflow to automatically start 2 statuses (to cause two SLA to start timing), however, In automation I don' t know how to\u00a0 branch on a separate approver group approving first.

Also, is there a way to build a custom form so only one client can see it but other clients can't in the same portal? Current global settings:",

A secondary question - it seems a service desk can have plain \"customers\"/\"organisations\" which are registered in the left-hand blade of the agent screen of the service desk. However, if you drill into the project settings in the \"People\" section, one can also add people here and assign a \"Service Desk customer\" role to that person. What's the difference?

The built-in Jira users importer is not doing the work since I can't get all the user information I need. I would like to avoid exporting information in CSV or JSON.

If the ticket is not updated after 21 days I want the rule to add a comment to the request that asks the assignee to provide an update to the request For the first 21 days, it the clock will start when the ticket is assigned. From that point the Assignee needs to provide an update at least every 3 weeks by adding a comment. In some cases the assignee will not share the comment with the customer though. He/She should not be penalized for this but i'm concerned that the system will not acknowledge the name of the SLA Start condition is called \"Comment: For Customers\" Assuming I can successfully do this, once the comment is added via the automation\u00a0 system clock be reset to zero and start a fresh 21-day cycle. For condition 1, does the comment have to be shared with the customer? For option 2 if the automation creates the comment will it reset the clock since the trigger is not made by the assignee nor the reporter Lastly, this just seems to be way more complicated than it needs to be. Is there another way to do this. Thanks.",

Tix-1 Tix 2 Tix 3 Assuming no other tickets are added to the system Oct 1 = 1 breach (Tix-3) Oct 2 = 1 breach (Tix-3) Oct 3 = 1 breach (Tix-3) Oct 4 =\u00a01 breach (Tix-3) Oct 5 =\u00a01 breach (Tix-3) Oct 6 = 0 breach Is this correct?",

I am not seeing ways to restrict request types to certain organizations, so I've setup a custom field called 'Support Tier'.\u00a0 I have an automation that is trigger on ticket creation and runs based on the Organization of the submitting customer.\u00a0 \u00a0This automation will set the 'Support Tier' field to \"Premium\".\u00a0 I currently have SLAs set up based on a 'SLA tier' that is determined via the request type (eg. 'SLA tier': \"1\" has a 1 hour response time).\u00a0 \u00a0I created a new SLA rule that looks at both the 'SLA tier' and 'Support Tier' (eg. 'SLA tier': \"1\" and 'Support Tier': \"Premium\" has a 30 minute response time). I did some testing (with an internal test organization), and while my automation will trigger, (adding the \"Support Tier\") the SLA was still under the base 1 hour, instead of my premium 30 minute response time. I suspect that the SLA is applied before my automation runs.\u00a0 My direct goal would be some way setup my SLAs in a way that I can have SLAs based on groups of customers - either set via a field trigger via automation, or if there are ways to 'tag' certain organizations.\u00a0 We've had issues with customers attempting to receive higher tier service using 'premium level' request types, so being able to restrict access to higher SLAs to the applicable organizations is the goal. I'd like to not have to create a separate project for this purpose, as there are downstream reporting concerns that rely on both a standard and premium support offering being evaluated together. The questions I hope to resolve are: 1. Can I have SLAs based on fields that are set via automations that run when a user opens a ticket? 2. If not, is there a way to restrict request types to blocks of customers. 3. Is there a way to force a customer to share a ticket with their organization to enable automations based off of the reporting user's organization? (We have customers that are in the same company but operate in different organizational units, so automations based on a user's domain name aren't possible) Thanks,",

Since JSM also doesn't \"reopen\" a ticket on its own when a ticket is closed and a customer replies and forces US to rely on an automation--it is ridiculous that I now have to \"pay\" for services that should be a no-brainer. We want to keep all work, and future questions or follow ups, in the original ticket. We've also seen that someone can reply to that closed ticket--and not know that we didn't see it.\u00a0 I'm fine not getting the \"Thank you!\" emails, but critical needs will get lost if I turn this automation off. Has someone out there found a non-automation way of handling this? I'm assuming it will mean more tickets that need to be connected and linked in the future?",

De alguna manera JSM detecta lo que es un reenv\u00edo autom\u00e1tico y lo bloquea de manera que ni aparece en el registro de entrada ni me lo rebota como correo no entregable?

But I don't want the field to be default entirely as it will always show hardware even on a software request. Not sure if I'm missing something, or it is an automation thing. I do have a feeling I may not exactly following the process (as in might as well get rid of hardware/software field if we have that separated in request type) but it sort of has other uses (including reporting) so was hoping to keep it.

In fact, I tested this theory by reports of my end users reporting they received notifications for these old/imported tickets. So my question is, do I need to just turn off the 'Request created' and 'Request resolved' customer notifications before doing the import?",

For example, we need to see how many Requests our technician Lexi completed the last 30 days. I was able to export to CSV a report that showed the past 30 days and the number of Requests she completed on each day, but that CSV report doesn't list anything else. I then selected 9/21/23 date and it showed key, request summary, reporter, assignee, request type, and resolution. I exported that to CSV but it doesn't show me any time tracked and it only lists the date completed as the title of the file, not on the actual sheet itself. My question is, are there any other ways to get all information onto one report? Or do we have to do it like this, create a report showing each Technician's completion throughout the month, then manually select each date and create another report off that? Even then, we are still missing time tracking, how can we find that information? Screenshots attached of the Excel list results, thanks!",

We are too far into our migration to hire a consulting company (which, in hind site, I would recommend to others in this situation - lesson learned) and tentatively plan to do our final cutover in 2 weeks. One MAJOR issue we have is that Scriptrunner conditions do not migrate to the Cloud. So, with each migration, we have to manually edit every item that uses Scriptrunner (a large number of automation rules and workflow transition conditions). We have asked Atlassian if we can export the workflow(s) (from Cloud) with all of the changes we have made, to Atlassian Marketplace (or just a file). This would allow us to save MANY hours of work. Then when we wipe our cloud test environment and do another test migration we would like to import those changes so we don't have to do the hours of manual labor. They can't or won't do this. We are a software company and we have developers who could actually do this, however, we don't have access to the database as we did on the server side. Is there anyone who would have any suggestions or recommendations on a way we could eliminate the hours of manual updates, capture this information, and be able to import them into our cloud environment?

We are looking at moving our system asset management into Assets, but we rather not have to purchase 50-100 JSM licenses only to grant view access of the data put into the items. Since there seems to be no way to grant view access with only a Jira license, and the Early Access Program to display Assets in Confluence is also restricted to only users with JSM licenses, the only way to move forward seems to be bulk exporting the asset data. What we are looking at is to do a daily export of all systems within our schema, and populate a Google Sheet with the info. How would we go about this?

Either way, here it is: My team is starting to use OpsGenie with Jira Service Management, and we want to figure out a way to automatically add Service object references (in an Assets field called \"Affected Services\") to pertaining incident tickets based on the tags that are added to the triggering alert in OpsGenie. For example, if I create an OpsGenie alert for responders in the \"IT Operations\" team, and if during the intake process I included two tags, \"Google Workspace\" and \"Atlassian\" respectively, in the JSM incident that is autopopulated, the \"Affected Services\" should be set as \"Google Workspace\" and \"Atlassian\". Is this at all possible? I saw a workaround KB posted recently called \"Add Affected Services on Opsgenie alert and update the same on the JSM ticket\" ( https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/add-affected-services-on-opsgenie-alert-and-update-the-same-on-the-jsm-ticket-1252000841.html\\ I tried implementing this workaround but the comments won't post to the JSM incident during the creation of the OpsGenie alert. It only works when I add tags to the alert after creating it. And it seems that it will only work for once service indicated when I need it to work with multiple tags/services indicated. In addition, I know there are some current limitations to the Opsgenie<->JSM integration where my ask my not even be possible: * Opsgenie and accessing custom Atlassian Assets object schemas ( https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/OPSGENIE-1622\\ * include the name of the Affective Services in payload sent between JSM and OG https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/OPSGENIE-1048\\ * Add the ability to associate Services with alerts ( https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-10605\\ Regardless, I still want to inquire to see if there's any way possible that I can take OpsGenie alert tags and use them to automatically add 'Affected Services' to the relating JSM incidents. If not, any resources or references you can point me to would work as well. Thanks,",

If there is no way of viewing/exporting project/workflows/automation settings, is there a logical diagram anywhere which maps the functional relationships between Projects/Forms/Automation/Workflows/work queues which would support me in manually documenting the portal config. settings so I can create a functional configuration document for change management purposes?\u00a0 The end result being that I will publish to Confluence so that if any changes are made to the project, the documentation can be updated by whoever makes the change.

We're using automation for Jira to do a web request (GET & POST respectively) that will retrieve and send information, using a dedicated integration account (Basic Auth with API token). This all is being done I running into an issue with the comments, that whenever the third party's ServiceNow's instance sends us a ticket in our Jira system and makes changes to the ticket including commenting, this works just fine. So I thought about a workaround to copy the internal and public comments to separate customfields, so these can be mapped. But I am having trouble finding the right smartvalues to put the public comments in Field A and the internal comments in Field B.

I couldn't find a way to turn these off so i made a rule in outlook to just move them to a different folder but then Jira will group the notifications together for each ticket, so emails letting me know of a new comment will get grouped with an automation alert and get moved to a different folder.

Is there a faster and more efficient way to do that? Thanks,",

I'm hoping someone can help with this.\u00a0 I've recently created a new team managed project within my company for our Finance team to help them work more effectively/efficiently and give them transparency on types of issues being received. The problem I'm experiencing is that because this is for our Finance team, they will be dealing with highly sensitive information therefore the project has to be set up as \"Private\", meaning only people who have specifically been given internal access (only Finance Team Members) can access this project. This is causing major issues when either an internal or external customer emails in a request to the Finance team and copies in (or sends direct and copy finance team in) an internal user who does not have access to the project as they do not receive any notifications advising of the issue being raised and cannot access that particular issue.\u00a0 Finance team are also unaware that the reporter has copied in an internal person who may be required to work within the issue. Does anyone know of any way I can get around this problem so we can enable view/add internal comment to any issue that an internal user has been copied in on, but does not allow them access to any other issue within the project?

In our Jira Service Management we enabled customer satisfaction which is a simple on-off switch:  For tickets created via Email (e.g. due to a partners system sending us a request via mail and where all communication happens via mail back to the email - so no one logging into our customer portal) we find a strange behaviour of getting exactly 2 min after the agent closed/resolved the ticket a satisfaction which is always 1 star. We might get an auto-email reply back from the partner saying something like \"we have got your request and are on it - please bear with us\" whenever we send an email to them triggered by an action in our Jira Service Management. We checked with many of those partners and they confirm that there is no user interaction involved their end - aka: no user is giving this rating based on our prompt to rate us. Of course all those 1 star ratings in such cases makes our average rating look quite low.  Question: Does anyone have an idea how to prevent auto-replies by partners to give a rating automatically? We have been searching high and low for any kind of automation in Jira (Service Management) already but have not detected any such thing.  Many thanks Kind Regards Isa",

I was under the impression that it's a CMDB feature, where I would be able to fill out \"anything I want\" as a Configuration Item (CI), and create upstream and downstream dependencies. In short, I'm looking for this: Service A runs on kubernetes cluster B using public IP address C, which is provisioned in Cloud Region D of Cloud Provider subscription E, running on top of kubernetes Nodepools F, G and H, consisting of Nodes I through P. (I'm probably going to omit the Nodes, to fluid and counterintuitive to the nature of kubernetes). However in \"Asset and configuration management\" I cannot for the life of me find an option to create a (functional) reference between two CIs and get a drilldown graph from the service down to the Nodepools? I've checked the Jira Service Management feature \"Services\", but there I also cannot link a Service to an Asset, only to other services? Really hoping to get this working, looking forward to your insights! :) Kind regards, Jimmy",

Within RETAIL and COMMERCIAL I want to have other portal groups for each product, as each product will have multiple request types and this would be a disaster to just have so many request types for all different products listed on one page.  Alternatively, if this is not possible. Would it be possible to create 2 separate customer portals, but have them linked in some way, that all the tickets are available under one project? So essentially to customer portals for one project.  Any suggestions or answers would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Peter",

        "details": "Hello all, I fear this issue is not something that can be resolved through the community, but I was advised by support that due to the account being in the free tier, my issue needs to be routed through here. Alas, I decided to separate my Atlassian Assist chat functionality from the Slack workspace I had initially used for testing. It was originally under a \"managers only\" Slack workspace. I have now decided to create a new Slack workspace, dedicated to IT helpdesk ticket creation/questions. As far as I could tell I did everything I could as far as removing ***OLD***.slack.com from the settings in Jira and Slack. I deleted the Slack Integration for that workspace as well as removed the Jira and Atlassian Assist Apps from that workspace. However, after adding ***NEW***.slack.com to the Slack Integration section in Jira Service management project settings, when I go to the Channels>Chat then Configure, it automatically forces me to add Atlassian Assist back to ***OLD***.slack.com. I tried to work around the issue by clicking the \"Add to Slack\" button on that page and then just changing the URL on the subsequent page to start with ***NEW***.com, which seemed to work. Unfortunately, when you go into the chat channel in the ***NEW*** Slack where the Atlassian bot should work, it doesn't activate/respond to commands. Also, when you click on the Atlassian Assist App in the Apps section, it says \"This is still a work in progress In the meantime, learn more about Atlassian Assist and what it can do by visiting the About tab.\" I have removed and re-added the app several times just to test if it was a temporary issue, and perhaps the project settings in Jira would reflect my workaround attempt to link the Atlassian Assist App to the New Slack Workspace. Has anyone encountered this and knows of a way to fix the issue? Thanks in advance for any advice or assistance, Stephen",

Current situation For the services we provide to our client, we need to keep uptodate copies of several thousands data sets / data objects. All objects have the same set of characteristics, like name, size, etc (in total about 20). On a regular basis, our client provides us with flat hierarchy data files (CSV or Excel) for the following requests: Create a new data object Change characteristics of an already existing data objects Delete a data object  Our goal We would like to replace the CSV- / Excel-based process. Presumably with something build upon Jira Service Management, but we are open for other suggestions as well. The volume of changes we need to process at once is relatively small, usually less than 10. No need for bulk edits, to process hundreds of data objects at once. All users would be logged in, thus we know to which business entity they belong. First step, users shall choose what to do: create / change / delete (see above) Create Basically a selection of text fields, drop-down-menus, single / multiple choices. Except for the text fields all fields shall be based on pre-defined lists / tables stored in an external data source (likely SQL). The data objects are hierarchically structured: thus, selections on early fields need to limit available selections on later fields Change Available data objects to choose from depend on the business entity of the logged-in user. Upon retrival of the selected object users shall see the current values for each field Next to each field the possibility to provide a new (updated) value. Again, for each field only pre-defined values shall be allowed. Deletion Select from a list of available data objects the one to be deleted Additional requirements We as well as our client are located within the European Union.\u00a0Some of the data object field carry personal identifiable information (PII). Thus compliance with the GDPR is required and most probably we need data residency. We are open for out of the box solutions build upon Atlassian features alone as well as features provided via marketplace apps. Thanks a lot!",

I have users I've added directly in OpsGenie, and I've never granted them a Product Role in Atlassian Admin (of User for Jira Service Management), but they're able to get into OpsGenie. By virtue of adding them as a User in OpsGenie (either User or Admin role), does that automatically give them the User Product Role for JSM in Atlassian Admin?\u00a0 I know both are licensed together under one license, but I'm not clear on what happens when a user is added directly to OpsGenie (as a User or Admin). This isn't clear to me, and from a provisioning standpoint, I want to make sure we understand how to craft our processes so that users added through OpsGenie are also added to the right groups in Atlassian Admin, not just to individual Product roles.

And we have the Planned End Date field that informs the end date/time of the implementation of the change. The team has a deadline of 1 hour after the Planned end date to finalize the change, otherwise it would have to mark the change as unfulfilled. But I'm having trouble setting up this expression. Changes that have been resolved within 1 hour of the planned end date will be marked as completed and those that have passed the 1 hour mark as not completed, that's the idea. Can you help me?",

Has anyone ever seen a solution (Script runner, automation, plugin, ...) allowing to expose, in one way or another, stories to the client so that he can validate them?  Thank you in advance for your feedback.  EDIT : We deliver web applications, the client must therefore validate each delivery (story). Today the developers insert a line indicating the delivered story in an Excel file, which is synchronized between JSM and JSW by the \"element & copy\" plugin. In the Excel file, the end customer has the possibility to validate or not the story delivered (by indicating the reason for refusal in free text form).  Delivery tests will always be carried out on a dedicated machine, this reflection concerns the replacement of the Excel file in order to be able to retrieve the customer's feedback directly in Jira without going through an Excel file, and to automate the developer part -> File of tests.",

Background info/context: When a customer makes a feature request to the CS team, a CS ticket is created for that request in a Customer Support project. From there, Product looks at these requests and links them to tickets in a Roadmap project. The first link is a link to an Epic (the area of the app the request pertains to), and the second link is one of the subtasks within the Epic that is more specific to the request itself. Example: A customer wants the settings section of the app to have user profile pictures (or something like that). After the support team creates the CS ticket, Product would link this request to the \"Settings\" epic, and then the \"User profile picture\" subtask within that epic. My question: Is there a way to create a pie chart in a dashboard that shows which subtasks are getting the most linked tickets from the start of this year to present day? What would be the best way to go about seeing this data? Additional note: Labels are not the most accurate in our use case so sadly aren't as solid of a data point to create this chart (would love to see the ability to manage labels better in Jira though!)

I am setting the resolution to \"Done\" as the first step in the transition post-function 4.

To make it easier I will simplify with an example. I have a Workflow with 3 Status (In Progress, Waiting for response, Resolved) If I have a ticket 2 hours in status \"In Progres\" and then changes to \"waiting for response\". I need a variable that will say, \"Time in status In Progress\" = 2 hours.\u00a0 Now if the ticket starts 2 hours in \"in Progress\", then changes to \"Waiting for response\" for 1 hour and then comes back to \"In progress\" for another 2 hours before being moved to \"waiting for response\" again. The variable now should show 4 hours. now if I look at that variable while the ticket it still in the status \"In progress\" it should add me up all the previous times the ticket has been in that status + the time it still is in that status. Why do I want this, its because if I want to organise in a queue for the amount of time the tickets have been and still are in the status \"in Progress\" without counting the time they have been outside. I accept if the varible is not continuous but could update with the time when you click it.  I was trying with some Date time pick variables and adding up and substracting time but never managed to write the proper JSON in the automation.  thanks a lot in advance",

We have to copy the ticket over to another project for processing, called \"DATA\" The user has requested that one field (Team) that has a list of \"user-friendly\" names that get converted to another name (System use) for the project users to work with. Example: Analytics Data Platform DPS Data Engineering What has been happening is that the Automation will not always assign the Team in the copied issue in \"DATA\". Sometimes the \"Team\" field is populated, other times it is not. What I did was to have the automation assign the appropriate team on the original ticket, then clone to the new Project. But the cloned ticket did not assign to the correct team, so then I had the subtasks mirrored on the original and copy. So it would assign the appropriate team, then copy the ticket to the new project, then the team assignment would repeat there as well. I have a suspicion that my automation is not formatted correctly, or I have chosen the wrong options when running subtasks in the automation. Basically I have 4 options in the \"Team\" section of the JSM form that need to be changed over to 4 differently named Teams in Jira. I've had to use scripting in order to perform this action. Attached is the automation rundown (sensitive info redacted) and an example of the script rename. So the Automation process should be: User selects a team to assign the issue and submits ticket THEN Assign appropriate team If Value 1 then Assign to Team 1 If Value 2 then Assign to Team 2 If Value 3 then Assign to Team 3 If Value 4 then Assign to Team 4 THEN Clone ticket to DATA project THEN Copy all values as in original ticket (including Team field) THEN Notify appropriate contacts You'll see that what I currently have is to assign the team, then Clone to new project, then once again assign the team (since it is not copying that info over on the clone). An example \"If/Then\" assignment is also below:  IF: THEN  Full automation: Thanks for any assistance.",

We have tried to come up with a solution to close those alerts as soon as they are created by adding the following rule in the JSM/OG integration for this project: We have done so, because every incident created by this feature, contains \"Incident raised\" within the summary of the alert: Regardless of this incoming automation rule, the alerts are not being closed once created.  Are there any suggestions work arounds to close these alerts? I also tried the event type, because as far as I can see, the alert type = Responder but that did not work either.  Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.  Regards Howard",

Once completed, it triggers the creation of several tickets related to the onboarding process. I am wondering if it would be possible to create a sort of two-stage form that accomplishes the following: - HR fills in first part of the form including name of the new employee's future manager. - After HR fills in its data, the manager is notified and completes the remaining form (or second stage of the form). - Once both steps are completed corresponding tickets are created (think prepare laptop, phone, workspace). Is this something I could realise within Jira Service Management?",

This requires using the \"Additional Fields\" dropdown/input, as for some reason, Jira Automation seems to reference custom fields by their names and not IDs by default. Note that this custom field is a \"Select List [Multiple Choices]\" field. Its name was recently changed to \"Team\", which overlaps with the Jira default already, and I have a feeling it may be renamed again in the near future. I'd like to be able to skip the \"fix every single automation that touches this field\" step in that renaming process in the future, if possible. I have set up this JSON: { And it seems like it would work if not for that field being required. This is the error that it throws: Error creating issue Team is required. (customfield_10080) Now, as seen above, this field is obviously being filled. I have tried replacing \"fields\" with \"update\", but then it throws an error about needing to be in an array format. I have tried removing the \"set\":, but it throws an error about JSON formatting. Is this simply not an option in the current state of Jira Cloud? Or am I just setting these fields incorrectly? Thanks for any future help on this.  EDIT: Giving more information: The Automation is a manual trigger intended to be used on an Epic. It has 5 \"Create Issue\" actions. Each one looks basically like this now: This is the automation log, with labels for when certain changes are made:",

If we set 2 hours for the time to first response and 8 hours time to resolution, based on when we do the \"take on\" the due date for the resolution changes. I give you an example: we receive a ticket at 8.00am. SLA first response is 10.00am and SLA related the resolution is time to first response + 8 hours. Therefore, if I do the take on of the ticket after 1 hour, we have a due date to fix it, if I do the take on after 2 hours we have a different due date. How can I set the time to resolution to be recalculated based on when we give the first response? many thanks",

So, the membership of group 'customers' in ANY project, determines whether they see items in a completely separate SM project. We're using SM 5.4.9 (DataCenter).",

We have a linked knowledge base with the appropriate permissions and the Atlassian Intelligence function is enabled (both for the product and for the request channel). Unfortunately, despite this, at the moment when the agent cannot assign the appropriate intention, instead of using the knowledge base, he simply creates a ticket and ends the conversation. Do you know how to solve this and make the virtual agent start using answers based on the knowledge base instead of mindlessly creatiing up tickets in the when there is no proper intention?

If we add an additional SSO into Atlassian, will all the account remain the same?

A little background: We plan to have two departments, A and B.\u00a0 Dept A cannot view tickets Dept B, but Dept B can view Dept A&B tickets. Dept A and B have different personnel but there are times when Dept B may need someone from Dept A Knowledge articles should be sharable, but others should be kept within their respective Dept. A common landing page would need to be created for issue submission. Based on my research, it seem the best approach was the multi-project approach to each department.\u00a0 I am not sure how relevant these arguments are in 2023, but the article I am referring to is: https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Service-Management-articles/Multiple-Projects-versus-a-Single-Project-in-Jira-Service/ba-p/1768572Multiple Projects versus a Single Project in Jira ... - Atlassian Community Questions: Groupings and ticket assignments - Should I invite members of each department as a Team or a Group?\u00a0 I have created Teams and assigned Project A with Team A and Project B with Team A&B, however when I try to assign a ticket from queue B to a member in A, the person does not appear. Multi-user assignment - Can a ticket have multiple users from multiple departments assigned to a ticket for their various tasks?\u00a0 Some folks would need to be assigned for visibility and may comment on the ticket if so desired. Incident sharing between projects - Should I go with the \"assign a subtask\" to the other team or create a linked issue?\u00a0 Are there permissions required to setup ahead of time to create/convert an ticket to a linked issue? Sharable artifacts - Are knowledgebase articles and canned responses sharable between projects?\u00a0 Making an article / canned responses would help building / maintaining a knowledge library. Landing page - What is the best way to build a landing page?\u00a0 Could anyone direct to an article / page they might be able to recommend for creating the workflow and streamline tickets to the correct bucket? Some of these workflows I am describing may be out of the date and we would be open to understanding the better approach; however it would benefit to understand the translation from the older ITSM to newer with justification as to why.\u00a0 I appreciate your thoughts and any feedback you can provide.

We already have a filter (I believe this was standard) and through this way we can choose which projects to showcase and which not (which is basically what we want). But, there is no option to save the current/chosen projects as a filter. Which means that everytime I change pages and return to the timeline, all projects are visible again. I assume it must be possible to save the filter? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.  Tim",

I have a post-function in the Create transition that creates the linkages between the laptop and the user. Is there a better way to solve this?

        "details": "Good day everyone,  I trust that all is well  Being in charge of our support teams processes, I want to ensure that we also take security seriously when it comes to users that log calls to our support team. We are a small business that is currently growing and rely on our systems to work for us. One of the settings that I want to turn on is under ''Customer Permissions '' with the specific setting to be turned on: '' Customers added to this service project only by agents and admins.'' The reason that we need this to be turned on is due to receiving multiple emails to our support team from users who do not exist and potential non-authorized users. This creates a host of issues for our support teams from wasting time on calls logged to potentially making changes\u00a0or handing out information to potential individuals who are not part of our customer base but might be posing as such. Now, turning the feature on is relatively\u00a0easy (this\u00a0also solves another issue where if the setting is turned on,\u00a0users will only have access to the relevant support portal - we currently have 2 support projects)\u00a0so this fixes 2 issues for us. It then leaves us with another issue where someone who might be an authorized\u00a0user has not been\u00a0added to Jira as a customer,\u00a0tries to log a call but does not receive any notification to tell them what to do in this case. I've\u00a0tried automation but it relies\u00a0on an issue being created first as a trigger before any other notification goes out to a user. I need to setup a notification for someone who has not being added to the system,\u00a0to tell them the reason they have not received an issue number and maybe give them some instructions to follow to become an authorized\u00a0user,\u00a0i.e., contact their administrator etc.  Any help or guidance will be greatly appreciated.

What we would need is to select the item type and the month and then populate the custom fields with the number of items, so we would only have to do it once for every item. The only way I found is with massive change, but we have a large number of items and it would take as longer to fill up all the data on Jira than exporting it to excel and doing the calculations there, as we are doing now.

        "details": "I am trying to set up an automation in a Jira Discovery project that allows me to clone a ticket when a field value is changed. For some reason, the delivery tickets on the delivery tab do not get cloned. I tried to specifically call out and copy all the link/links/linked issues names of fields I could find, but none of them copy the links or the delivery ticket from the trigger ticket. Here is the audit log. In this step I actually did copy as well the default \"linked issues\" field that is driven by the Link issue button on the ideas overview screen, but that does not show up on the cloned ticket either. Funnily enough, just hitting the clone button on the UI actually does copy across all linked issues and delivery tickets. I have set up the automation originally just for my discovery project, then multiple projects (to see if including the delivery project was the problem) and then finally global, but none of these clone everything",

Currently reporters do not receive email notifications when a\u00a0 'Share with customer' comment is added. This is due to the customer notifications setting for 'public comment added' not being sent to 'Reporter (customer)'. However, reporters receive an email from public comments because they are '@mentioned' by agents - but this isn't always the case as some agents don't/forget to use the '@mention'. So, I have added 'Reporter (customer)' to the\u00a0'public comment added' customer notification settings. Now they receive an email if the public comment is added. But, when a public comment is added and the '@mention' is used for the reporter, it sends two emails notifications. One for the public comment added and one for the '@mention'. Is there a way of sending only one email if both actions (public comment and @mentioning the reporter) are used together? Thanks",

        "details": "Afternoon all I hope you can help? We have subscribed to the Premium Jira Service Management plan. Ive setup a basic monitoring platform using Amazon Managed Prometheus and Amazon Managed Grafana.\u00a0 In Amazon Managed Prometheus we have AlertManager outputting alerts to SNS as this is the only receiver currently supported by Amazon Managed Prometheus.  Can you advise on a sensible way to configure Jira Service Management and OpsGenie? Im struggling with finding documentation that can advise a process/flow.  We are a little confused as to how it is laid out/configured. We want to be able to create issues into Jira based on severity level labels passed from AlertManager. Any alerts that are P1 or P2 are automatically sent to OpsGenie to alert the on call team. If the alert is P3 or P4 its to create a Jira ticket and alert the relevant team between office hours. P5 informational can just go directly to slack for the team to be aware of a small issue thats not service impacting. We also have a Jira portal where issues can be created manually. Again if its a P1/P2 its sent to OpsGenie to alert the relevant teams. Do we need to create the project in Jira then in OpsGenie create our teams. Under each OpsGenie team do we then configure the integration with Jira Service Management\u00a0 and configure rules which send traffic to destinations based on alert level?  Also under each team in OpsGenie I believe we should subscribe to the SNS topic that AlertManager writes into allowing OpsGenie to see these topic events.  So the rules/flow would be something like this I think?  Web Service Portal > Jira Service Management > OpsGenie integration > P1/P2 alert via OpsGenie, create Jira incident ticket, slack channel etc  Web Service Portal > Jira Service Management > OpsGenie Integration > P3/P4 > create Jira Incident Ticket for investigation during office hours.\u00a0No on call alerts raised.  AlertManager > SNS Topic > OpsGenie > Jira Service Management Integration > P1/P2 alert via OpsGenie, create incident Jira ticket and slack channel.  AlertManager > SNS Topic >\u00a0 OpsGenie\u00a0 > Jira Service Management Integration > P3/P4 create Jira ticket and send to relevant team to investigate during office hours. No on call alerts raised.  AlertManager > SNS Topic > OpsGenie > Jira Service Management integration > P5 information sent to team via slack to investigate during office hours only. No on call alerts raised.  Were just a bit confused at the moment and would appreciate some guidance - especially if you have used Jira Service Management with Amazon Managed Prometheus in the past.

So instead of having one Atlassian Assist bot with multiple Help Desks and their respective request options, is it possible to have different bots for each Help Desk. For Example: One help desk bot named \"IT Help Desk\" for IT requests and a different help desk bot named \"HR Help Desk\" for HR requests. I'd like to make a third, but the \"customers\" for that third help desk shouldn't have access to the other desks. Having the two of them there (like in the screenshot) isn't necessarily a big deal, just want to know if there is any way to have a completely separate bot for a team of contractors who do not have access to the the HR and IT help desks ( those desks are only for full-time employees  Thank you in advance for any advice or solutions you can think of!",

Although there are lots of similarities, each customer will need its own custom portal and each customer will probably need its own inbound support email address (unless we can filter using the sent from domain). \u00a0I would also like to be able to track time spent supporting each individual customer. Given the above requirements, I was thinking that individual projects will be better, but operationally for our team it might be better to have 1 project. Please can you share your thoughts.

A 187% view zoom is very annoying because the user has to immediately hit the minus button at the bottom of the window to shrink the doc to 100% or somewhere around normal size for comfortable reading. MS Word has a toggle under \"view\" to zoom with size of window. Jira attachments seem to open/view at \"size-to-window\" by default. Is there a way to turn-off the \"size-to-window\" view in Jira? We would like 100% view by default.\u00a0 This auto-stretch wastes time & productivity.

        "details": "Hi there! I have a project with 4 different issue types. These issue types have different SLAs for Time to Resolution. e.g. For Epic, I have set it as 48hrs with the condition that it should 'start the count' from 'To Do' and 'to pause' when waiting for user and so on... Now I am trying to create another SLA for time to resolution for Story that starts with 'To do' as the first step and set 72h as the goal and here, the count should start from 'Open' and should not start from 'To Do'. How do I make this work? I tried adding the conditions as per the requirements and also tried adding a new SLA for resolution but the original 48h keeps popping up probably because of the older condition for Epic? Please help! Thanks! Best, JJ",

Going to the validators configuration part for transition, we have not found a way to add a SIL script as validator.

        "details": "Hello all, I am hoping someone might have suggestions as to why this might have happened, but we recently saw some changes to tasks that had been closed for 2 years. In two cases, the users that were referenced as making the changes no longer exist within our Jira account. Their accounts were deactivated months or years ago. In another instance, the task is showing as being changed by \"Anonymous\". The final instance shows a current user updating a task status, but that user confirms that they did not make any changes to the task, as the project has been closed and we no longer work on the application to which it relates. We do not currently have any integrations into our Jira Service Management that would allow a task to be updated from another application, so we are a bit perplexed as to how this may have happened. Any thoughts or insights would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance",

So this is like a 1:1 match of maybe 40 possible users. There are 3 groups of users (departments) so the essential project automation is for 3 branches (for current issue):  Branch - for current issue Issue check JQL ~ if cf[nnnnn] ~\"12345\" or cf[nnnnn] ~\"23456\" etc. If cf[nnnnn] = \"12345\" then cf[mmmm] = \"John Doe\" repeated for each user id for that department as some departments have 10, some have 20, etc.  Next branch for current issue for next department has similar, and finally last of the 3 branches for the 3rd department. All 3 branches are similar in that JQL qualifies the userIDs that would be part of that, and just does if thens for each to populate the drop down value. The JQLs validate and gives the number of issues for each so I know the JQL works. But in tracing the history, I get success but the drop down value is blank on those issues so something is not working to populate the name in the drop down. Also, if there's a better way to do this I would be open to that but essentially it's taking a userID and trying to set a name in a drop down so likely there is no other way without another system involved to translate userID to name.",

Apparently, this issue didn't exist a month or two ago when I first created canned responses. I have canned responses WITH file attachments in them, and they work perfectly (see below snip)! But strangely, when I edit a canned response or try to create a new canned response, I just can't add any more attachments. I'm sure when I first created these I was able to click and drag files right into it. This doesn't work anymore. What's the fix? Thanks!",

And SLA should be turned on, because it does functions generally with most cases/most people. Here are the SLA settings:    A picture of the history of this specific case:   I have two working theories: 1. It might be because the supporter changes the status, before he puts in the comment. When he makes the comment, he might not be in \"waiting for support\" and instead being in some other status like \"waiting for customer\" or \"pending external\". 2. Because he is Jira admin, there might be some reason for why SLA does not register.  Kind regards, Fuji - Project coordinator - project administrator on Jira",

However, if I reply to any emails, clients get an additional email from Jira that I'd rather they didn't receive. They should only get my response because when they reply back to me, they also receive another email from Jira. I've tried going into the project settings and deactivating all customer notifications but doing so stops all incoming emails to Jira entirely. What's crucial for me is that all my account emails are directed to Jira so everything can be managed from there and responses sent directly through it as well. When a client responds back, their message should be added straight onto Jira too. But what shouldn't happen is them receiving an email indicating that they're part of the system within Jira itself. Does anyone know how this can be configured? Thank you.",

We're looking to add the ability to query and sort assets based on which team the assets were deployed to.\u00a0Insight pulls user name and email information from AD, but as far as I can tell, it can't pull a user's associated team information from AD. Ideally, we'd have a secondary field for \"Team\" that would automatically populate when the \"Contact\" field is updated with a new user. For example, John Doe is on Team A. If I were to go to an object, change the \"Contact\" field to \"John Doe\", the \"Team\" field should auto-populate \"Team A\". The result of this being that I could later query all assets assigned to \"Team A\" and it would return all of John Doe's assets as well as all assets assigned to other members of Team A. We could create this \"Team\" field and manually assign and updates teams on an ongoing basis, but with thousands of assets this would be a large lift up-front and would be difficult to accurately maintain over time. Has anyone else created or explored similar functionality? If this is not possible in Insight, are there any third-party plugins that could improve AD integration? We're also open to alternative ideas and solutions. Thank you!",

I've had a support ticket open for weeks but because the ticket was created by Atlassian support themselves to split a question off from another ticket, the original time zone was set to Asia but I am based in the UK. On Monday I requested if the ticket can be moved to someone who deals with my time zone as I am to tired having to constantly respond to support tickets during my night time. I've had the Queue Manager message me saying he will try and find someone, then on Tuesday I had a support engineer finally respond only to say that he will move the ticket from the Jira Cloud team to the Jira Server team. It's Thursday now and still no response! I've explained numerous times that this is an urgent problem as I was hoping to start the final and live migration next week but it seems Atlassian support is once again non existent. I've escalated the ticket too but without any answer. At the moment I've advised our management team to hold fire on signing the order form because I feel the issue with Atlassian support are just not going away. I'm hoping someone here can help please. As part of various trial migrations, I found an issue with several hundreds of our tickets. It seems these tickets were created as Issue Type \"Task\", but the original person who created our Jira Service Desk must have either removed the Request Type or never set it up. The migration support person said that I need to fix this issue before doing another migration, but this is where I am stuck. The error that shows up within these tickets are: \"There are no issue types with compatible field configuration and/or workflow associations. The issue type can only be changed by moving  I've tried to create a new Request Type for the Issue Type Task but that hasn't helped either.

        "details": "Hi, I'm trying to create a validator using JMWE which would ensure that a comment entered during a transition is not an external/public comment, but an internal comment instead. Basically, how this works in Jira is that in JSM, a pop-up will display when you have a screen configured with the transition, which will contain the Comment field. Being a JSM project, the Comment field will present itself with two tabs: 1. Respond to Customer, 2. Internal comment with the first one being active by default. As you know, users often times (even with training) will simply add a comment and submit without double-checking which tab is selected (in this specific scenario, I want the comment to always be internal-only), which would cause trouble with our customers. That said, regardless of which tab is selected, I wanted to use the JMWE validator to alert the user in case the wrong tab is selected. In contacting JMWE support, they told this used to be possible with the following Jira Expression, which would force the user to input a public comment (which is the opposite of what I want) during a transition. However, it is not working as intended anymore: issue.comments.some(c=>c.id == null) && (!issue.comments.filter(c=>c.id == null)[0].properties.get(\"sd.public.comment\")|| !issue.comments.filter(c=>c.id == null)[0].properties.get(\"sd.public.comment\").internal) Not sure if this is a regression bug in JSM or Atlassian intentionally blocked this from working... Any help will be greatly appreciated. Cheers!",
