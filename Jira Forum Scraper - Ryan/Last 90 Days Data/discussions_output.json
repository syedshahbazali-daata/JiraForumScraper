By observing the structure of the JSON provided by ProForma \":\" (colon) USING ASSETS In my case, our Support team has severity matrices based on the product, and therefore, each type of issue has a different severity for priorities such as High, Blocker, Medium, and Low.

I couldn't find anything about that in the documentation and I couldn't find a way to actually add a json key and value to the REST calls to make sure the backend fields are used, and not the customer portal fields (which have different required fields in out setup) . I had to actually flip this switch in the UI, which I discovered on a wild hunch as I was desperately trying to figure out why I get blocked by customer portal field requirements. My expectation was that\u00a0\"rest/api/2/issue\" always uses the backend fields as it is not a JSM endpoint and if any endpoint was going to be using the customer portal fields instead then it would have been \"rest/servicedeskapi/request\", but this is not the case, it seems. I have not tested how\u00a0\"rest/servicedeskapi/request\" behaves yet. So maybe somebody could share their knowledge here if it simulates the customer or agent creation process. So this post is about raising awareness and asking if there is a way to set this within one of the issue creation REST calls or maybe if there is a different call entirely to set this flag.",

The team is looking to rework their setup so that they can get very detailed reporting on the status of a request as well as track the time and work being spent. My approach is to have their existing service desk simply track the high level statuses, i.e. - In Progress, Waiting for Customer (or Support, or Vendor), and have a backend Software project for the specific state of the work, i.e. - Design, Review, Development, QA, UAT, Deployment. That presents me with two options: Create these specific Statuses for the backend project with a complex workflow (not all Statuses used for all requests), or break down the various steps into subtasks that reflect the status - a subtask for Design, another for Review, etc. I know in either case I can link the backend task (or task and subtasks) to the front end ticket. What I don't know, because I am light on Report/Filter/Dashboard knowledge, is how difficult either of these options will be to report on. And finally, is my approach wrong? Should I instead be highly customizing the service desk to track all the specifics? To me that seems counter-intuitive and a lot of work, but most of what I know about Jira design is from necessity and what my org wants, and not necessarily the best way to do things. I honestly would welcome any and all feedback. I'm sure there are many different ways people are handling similar situations, and I'm trying to get a sense for what has worked best for others.",

        "details": "Hi all,  this topic ist about best practices, experiences and pitfalls while managing your users and customers of Jira service Management and Jira Software. While we have had a clear guideline how to manage our users and customers for years, we review this because of the introduction of the \"Customer service management (early access)\" feature within JSM an couple of weeks ago. Some definitions upfront User = Account granted a user role in Jira Software Customer = Account granted customer role in Jira Service Management Service Agent = Account granted Service Agent role in Jira Service Management all combinations of the above roles are possible Jira user group = a group of accounts, defined within Administration as a group  Current state We are an organization with multiple companies and have following access management: Jira user group company[A-Z].employees All employees are member of their specific Jira user group We have granted the group the Customer role for JSM The User group is added to out internal IT Helpdesk via \"people\"  During an onboarding of a new employee, we add an Atlassian Account with his mail and add this account to the specific Jira user group company[A-Z].employees. The user receives the invitation from Atlassian to complete his registration and he can use the internal IT Helpdesk. We do not use the customer invitation from JSM. Why? we have following lessons learned: Adding a customer via Service Management invitation, Cretes a \"customer only\" account. This Account is managed in a different way opposed to all \"normal\" Jira user accounts. Doing so, we had some struggle, when the user was upgraded to a Jira User. We had one Account in the Service Management Customer Section and one Account in the \"real\" user administration. Due to compliance and clean-up management this was a pain. That's why we decided this way. While we manage users this way, we don't use JSM \"organizations\". A Jira user group can't be assigned to a JSM organizations. So, we have no organizational view of the ticket situation from the organization view. But this is not an issue, because the it was low value due to separation of unresolved of resolved issues and no quick view. New State with \"Customer service management\" The new feature delivers some great new views to our service agents. As a service agent, it's now possible to see resolved and unresolved issues in a quick overview. And all in one search result. Same for organization. And the option to add custom field to customers and organization. We don't use this feature by now, still in the think tank how to use and maybe how to integrate with other systems. We gave the new organization view a try and added mail-addresses of employees of a specific company to the JSM organization. As a result, we have a quick view of what's going on within the specific company. This is pretty cool. Adding Jira user groups does not work. The Issue When we want to use the new organization view of the new Customer service management feature, we have to manage two lists of users (the Jira user group and the organization in JSM). Or re-arrange our current onboarding and account management for Applications and the IT-Helpdesk.  The Question What is your best-practice approach about User and Customer management and experience with the new \"Customer service management\" feature?",

Quite a few answers out there which also match the same mechanism being used here, ScriptRunner Behaviours.\u00a0 However most answers I found required the script author to explicitly list the values that should be displayed.\u00a0 While this does achieve the same end goal it is getting all options excluding none, not actually removing none. What happens if me or a future system admin adds additional options to the fields, they will not show and the behaviours will have to hunted down, modified, and tested.\u00a0 Additionally, if we wanted to do this with multiple fields, the script can become lengthy and prone to human typos.\u00a0 We've all done it. My solution has started as a simple behaviour script to remove 'none' from three fields with less lines of scripts and will not require modification when new options are added. The current script is: import com.atlassian.jira.component.ComponentAccessor import com.atlassian.jira.issue.customfields.manager.OptionsManager hideNone( \"Field 1\" ) hideNone( \"Field 2\" ) hideNone( \"Field 3\" ) def hideNone ( String FieldName ){  def optionsManager = ComponentAccessor .getComponent( OptionsManager )  def field = getFieldByName( FieldName ) field.setAllowInlineEdit( true )  def fieldId = customFieldManager.getCustomFieldObject(field.getFieldId())  def fieldConfig = fieldId.getRelevantConfig(getIssueContext())  def fieldOptionsOriginal = optionsManager.getOptions(fieldConfig)  def fieldOptionsCustYes = fieldOptionsOriginal.findAll { it.value !in [ \"none\" ] } field.setFieldOptions( fieldOptionsCustYes ) } The next step will be to create a helper class script so that the same hideNone method can be used on multiple behaviour scripts whenever it is needed, without having to duplicate the same lines of code.

        "details": "Artificial intelligence is becoming more prevalent in our daily lives, with OpenAI's ChatGPT being one of the standout examples. Since its launch, I have dedicated a significant amount of time to studying it. As I am a Jira administrator, I decided to integrate ChatGPT with Jira Service to automate ticket triage with OpenAI's artificial intelligence. In this article, even if you're not a developer, you will learn: Why delegate triage to an AI Requirements for Automatic Ticket Triage Prompt to triage and analyze sentiment in Jira How You Can Integrate Jira Service with ChatGPT (Step by Step) Costs and Savings Generated Future of AI ticket triage And if you still have questions by the end, you can reach out to me directly to continue the conversation. \ud83e\udd14 Why delegate triage to an AI?  Triaging tickets manually can be a time-consuming and error-prone task, and by delegating this function to an AI, companies can benefit in several ways: Accuracy: Efficiency: Workload Reduction: In the image below, you can see ChatGPT filling in the Sentiment, Service, and Sentiment Reason fields automatically:   \ud83d\udccb Requirements for Automatic Ticket Triage with\u00a0ChatGPT  During the configuration of the ChatGPT integration, I specified that the AI must complete the following fields: Sentiment [Select Field]: Service [Select Field]: Sentiment Reason [Paragraph Field]:  \ud83d\udcca\u00a0Hey, can you imagine how many reports you can do with this here?* \ud83d\ude09  \ud83d\udcac\u00a0Prompt to triage sentiment analysis of Jira tickets Now that we know what the requirements are for our automatic ticket triage, it's time to create a prompt in ChatGPT that answers all these questions. For this purpose, we will use the prompt below:  The prompt above is clear about its purpose, but I've highlighted three important sections of the image above. Are they: I put all available options in the Service field of my Jira project to ensure that ChatGPT always selects a valid option in Jira. I requested that the result be returned in JSON format to save with requests for queries in the ChatGPT API. I made it clear that ChatGPT must consider the ticket description that is between the <description></description> delimiters.  When running a real case directly in the ChatGPT console, I get a response like the one below:  \u2705 You can see this prompt in the GitHub repository at this link: https://bit.ly/ticket-triage-prompt-in-jira   \ud83e\udd16 What do you need to do the integration? Integrating Jira Service with ChatGPT can seem complex at first glance, but with the right steps, the process is simplified. All you need is: A token to access the OpenAI API (ChatGPT): link An app that allows you to connect to the OpenAI API: Jira Misc Workflows Extensions (JMWE) Appfire Creating a token to access the ChatGPT API The first thing you need to connect with the OpenAI API is an authentication token, and you can do that by following the steps below: Go to OpenAI's official website: https://openai.com/ Create if you don't already have one Then, authenticate with your username on the Platform View API Keys: \u2139\ufe0f Note: It is worth noting that using the ChatGPT API has associated costs. When creating an API key, you will likely be taken to a payment page to enter your credit card information. OpenAI offers a $5 bonus for new users to try out the API as an incentive.  Configuring Jira Misc Workflow Extensions in JMWE Jira Misc Workflow Extensions Jira's integration with OpenAI (ChatGPT) was done by JMWE through the architecture below:  Below you can see a step-by-step on how to perform the integration described above: Step 1: Create an Entity Property to store the ChatGPT response You can do this by following the steps below: Create a post function of type \u201c Set Entity Property value\u201d. Then, fill in the \u201cProperty Name\u201d field with the value \u201ctriage_info\u201d (or any other name you prefer). In the \u201cValue\u201d field, insert this script Scroll down to the \u201cOptions\u201d section, check the parameter \u201c Treat value as JSON Click Save When this post-function is ready, and you place it in a transition in your project's Workflow, Jira will generate an Issue Property like the image below whenever the transition is executed:  This Entity Property is a JSON with all the information we need to fill in the Sentiment, Service (Category), and Sentiment Reason fields. \ud83d\ude09 Step 2: Create a post-function to update Jira fields Create a post function like \u201c Set issue fields (JMWE app)\u201d. Select the Sentiment field. In the Value field, enter this script After completing the steps above, and these post-functions are correctly configured in your Jira Workflow transitions, the tickets will be automatically sorted as in the image below:  The Cost of Automation with ChatGPT \ud83d\ude80 Good news for managers and executives! $0.0005515 per ticket See the table below for how much the monthly amount would be to automatically sort Jira tickets through ChatGPT:  I ncredible, isn't it?  But how did I arrive at this value? Let's dive into the details. Tokens: The AI Currency The ChatGPT API charges based on the number of tokens processed. Tokens can be words, characters and even symbols, varying by language. While we can estimate the number of tokens that text might consume, determining the exact number of tokens used by the ChatGPT API to process and respond to a specific prompt involves complex variables and cannot be predicted with absolute precision. Understanding Token Calculation Calculating tokens in ChatGPT may seem complex at first glance, but we can simplify it for practical purposes. While there are a lot of technicalities behind this calculation, I'll present a simplified approach using just two variables: Number of Words Language Factor The simplified formula for estimating the amount of tokens is: Estimated Number of Tokens The following table illustrates an estimate of tokens for a text of 100 words in three different languages: English, French and Portuguese. Using the formula above, we can get a rough idea of how many tokens are needed for each language: \u2139\ufe0f Note: Keep in mind that this is a simplified approach and the actual number of tokens may vary based on many factors, including the complexity of the text and the response generated. And how much does each Token cost? As of the date of publication of this article, the prices charged by OpenAI for processing messages sent to its API are: With GPT-3.5 Turbo model and 4K context: $0.0015 for 1K tokens $0.002 for 1K tokens With GPT-3.5 Turbo model and 16K context: $0.003 per 1K tokens $0.004 per 1K tokens To illustrate: if you send a prompt of 200 tokens and receive a response of 800 tokens with the 4K model, the cost is 1000 tokens. This translates to: (200 tokens * $0.0015) + (800 tokens * $0.002). Estimates Based on Actual Data To determine how many tokens the ChatGPT API might need when processing messages, I analyzed several databases in Jira Service Management. The objective was to identify the average number of words per ticket, considering different types of projects. The following table shows the average number of words in both the original ticket (input) and the response generated by ChatGPT:  Based on the average number of words per project type, we can calculate the estimated amount of tokens that the ChatGPT API will need to process the messages. The formula for this estimate is: Tokens (Input) = ([Number of Base Prompt Words \u2139\ufe0f Note: link Tokens (Response) = [Number of Words in ChatGPT response] * [Language Factor]  For example, for a Servide Desk IT project in English, it would be: Tokens (Input) = (153 words + 37 words) x 1.5 =~ 285 tokens Tokens (Answer) = 41 x 1.5 =~ 62 tokens  Now, with the total number of tokens for input and response, we can calculate the cost using OpenAI pricing for ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo: Entry Price (input) = Entry Tokens / 1000 x $0.0015 Response Price (output) = Response Tokens / 1000 x $0.002  Total cost Entry = 285 tokens x $0.0015/1000 = $0.0004275 Answer = 62 tokens x $0.002/1000 = $0.000124 Total = $0.0004275 + $0.000124 = $0.0005515  Conclusion: Based on this estimate, the cost to triage a ticket in an IT Service Desk environment using English is just $0.0005515 per ticket. I'd like to emphasize that this is an estimate based on data I've collected from the instances I manage and conversations with other Jira admins. Each environment has its own specificities and characteristics. Additionally, OpenAI's pricing policies may change from time to time. The purpose of this section of this article is to provide an overview on costs. I strongly recommend conducting specific studies in your Jira environment before any implementation to determine the monthly cost. Also, please visit the OpenAI  \ud83d\udd2e\u00a0The future of ticket triage with AI Integrating tools like ChatGPT into Jira has already demonstrated the transformative power of artificial intelligence in ticket management. While AI currently assists in sentiment sorting and analysis, the potential for future optimizations is immense. The continuous evolution of technology suggests that soon we will have even more integrated solutions, making support processes more agile and accurate. In a world where efficiency is crucial, combining Jira and AI promises to be a milestone in the customer service revolution.  \ud83d\udce2 Let's Talk! I look forward to hearing your experiences!

Use the variable in Email and Name {{newCustomer}} Additional Step if you want to add users as Request Participants, Add action and find the Re-fetch issue data. Add action of Edit Issue, find the Request participant field and use the same variable {{newCustomer}}. The 7th-8th Step is to add the user to request a participant.

Depending on which request is sent, a different automated message is sent to the customer. The way we are currently doing it is with an automation that adds a public comment to the ticket, which is then sent by email to the costumer. Depending on the type of request, it adds a different text. It works fine, it gets the job done, but only in one language (Spanish). We are currently preparing the portal to add another language (English) and we are facing the problem that, even if everything is in English, the automated responses will still be sent in Spanish. How could we send this messages in different languages? The easier solution would be having the texts in both Spanish and English, but if there was a way, we would prefer to have the texts in the same language as the request. Thank you!",

I ran across this discussion: Connecting a Service Desk to a Classic Software JIRA project but it doesn't address a significant need we have - collecting data that would be mapped to the backend project for reporting. Our use case: We have a department, currently hosting a service desk, that wants significant custom field additions and complex workflows. My thought was to setup the backend project as team-managed so that there are few to no global system changes required. The SD agent would maintain all communications with the requester via the original ticket, but all the work would be managed in the backend. We would collect all the necessary information up front through the use of a form. The problem is that only the standard fields in the front end project can be mapped (to my knowledge). The custom fields that only exist in the backend would not be visible to map. Is there functionality or an app that I'm missing that could accomplish what I'm trying to do?",

Undoubtedly, different people implement these add-ons in various ways, with different goals and methods.

So, I would like to ask you directly: What are your methods for searching for add-ons for Jira? What criteria do you use when choosing solutions?
